### Songr Spring APP

This lab asked to create a Database and connect to that database to displace the albums in your database.

I created a Album class.

I created a Album constructor.

I created a Album controller.

I created a Album template in HTML format to display on the Web.

You should be able to run my program in the terminal using ./gradlew bootRun
